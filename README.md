# CNN for Number MNIST Dataset

This repository uses `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Keras`

## Description

This deep learning image classification model that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify numbers. The model is trained on the Number-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 grayscale images of numbers.

The final accuracy achieved by the model is reported, indicating how well the model is able to classify numbers 0-9. Check out the script [here](Deep_Learning_mnist_dataset.ipynb).
